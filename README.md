# AngularPwaIgdbDemo

Small Angular 8 PWA Demo that shows what Angular and PWA's do. 

## IGDB Api

* You need to register in the api `https://www.igdb.com/users/new`
* Insert your api token in environment.ts and environment.prod.ts
* For a production environment you need to setup a reverse proxy server(IGDB limitations). Here's a tutorial for IIS `https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/friis/2016/08/25/setup-iis-with-url-rewrite-as-a-reverse-proxy-for-real-world-apps/`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
